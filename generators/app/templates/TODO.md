# Project todos

This project was generated with the [BlueGenes Tool Generator](https://github.com/intermine/generator-bluegenes-tool), which has
produced the basic files needed for your tool. You'll still need to handle the implementation details, though.

## Todos before this is release-ready:

- [] edit [src/index.js](src/index.js) and add code to initialise your tool
- [] add any css styles to [src/style.less](src/style.less)
- [] update demo.html to show a demo of your tool
- [] add `preview.png` to the root directory of this repo. This image will be used to preview your tool.
- [] update your tool's description in [README.md](README.md)
- [] edit package.json and point to your github repository, something like ```  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git@github.com:intermine/someRepo.git"
  },```
