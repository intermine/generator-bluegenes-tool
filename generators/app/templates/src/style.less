.<%= toolNameCljs %> {
  // put all your css classes inside this block. Keeping them
  // nested under the tool name prevents your styles from
  // leaking out and affecting other elements by accident.

  // If you want to learn more about LESS, visit lesscss.org.

  // Tips to ensure your tool works well in BlueGenes:
  // - Pretend that the browser window your tool runs in is the container provided by BlueGenes
  // - Use all the width you're given, but only the height you need (hardcoding to a specific height is fine)
  // - Avoid vw/vh values as these will work unexpectedly when your tool is used in BlueGenes
  // - Do not have a header for your tool; BlueGenes provides one above the container
  // - BlueGenes will ensure your tool is scrollable if it's larger than the container
  // - The space given by BlueGenes is precious; make your visualization occupy most of it and avoid having settings that occupy a large part of it
  // - Remember that loaders should only apply to your container, not fade out the whole window

  // this is just an example class for root div element, you may modify or delete it as per your usecase
  .rootContainer {
    padding: 10px;
  }
}
